        <h2>Here's a time line of Whitney Houston's life:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>1963</b>  - Born in Newark, New Jersey</li>
            <li><b>1978</b>  - Whitney was performing often with her mother and trying to get a record deal of her own. Around the same time, she was discovered by a photographer who was awed by her natural beauty. She soon became an extremely sought-after teenage model, one of the first African-American women to appear on the cover of Seventeen magazine. But music remained her true love.</li>
            <li><b>1982</b> - Was discovered in a nightclub by the renowned Clive Davis of Arista Records, who signed her immediately and took the helm of her career as she navigated from gospel to pop stardom.</li>
            <li><b>1985</b>  - She released her debut album Whitney Houston and almost immediately became a smash pop sensation. Over the next year, her hit singles "Saving All My Love for You" and "How Will I Know" helped the album reach the top of the charts, where it stayed for 14 non-consecutive weeks.</li>
            <li><b>1992</b>  - Whitney Houston married the R&B singer Bobby Brown, formerly of New Edition, after a three-year engagement. At first the marriage was passionate and loving, but things turned sour as the decade progressed and both Brown and Houston battled substance abuse and increasingly erratic behavior.</li>
            <li><b>1994</b>  - With the success of her music, Houston received offers of film work, including work with Robert De Niro, Quincy Jones and Spike Lee, but she did not feel the time was right.[106] Her first film role was in The Bodyguard, released in 1992.</li>
            <li><b>1998</b>  - Houston hadn't recorded a full-length studio album in eight years. During discussion over a possible greatest hits album with Clive Davis, however, it was agreed that Houston should return to the studio for a brand new album instead.</li>
            <li><b>2012</b> - dies at the age of 49</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="quotation">"When I decided to be a singer,<br>
            My mother warned me I'd be alone a lot.<br>
            Basically we all are.<br>
            Loneliness comes with life".<br>
            <br>--Whitney Houston
